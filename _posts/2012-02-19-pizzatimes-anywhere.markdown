Today I added new feature [Pizzatimes.org Anywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bplpkhmcklnghjkiflchdmkmegcoamle) to [pizzatimes.org](http://pizzatimes.org/top).<br>
About pizzatimes.org itself, see [my previous article](/2012/02/pizzatimes.html).<br>
Pizzatimes.org Anywhere is a Chrome Extension which enable us to communicate on any web site, using pizzatimes.org BBS system.<br>
